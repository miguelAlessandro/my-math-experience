### easy

- prove that homomorphism map identity elements to identity elements.

- prove that homomorphism map inverses to inverses.

- prove that the inverse of an homomorphism is an homorphism

- Let G be a group with subgroups H and K, where HK = G (that is, every g
\in G can be written as hk for some h \in H and k \in K). In addition,
suppose every element of H commutes with every element of K, and H \cap K = {e}.
The, G is homomorphic to HxK. (hint. use a function f that HxK to G)

- prove that Z_m x Z_n is cyclic (with addition operation).

- show that S_n is not abelian if n \geq 3

### medium

- show that if the orders of groups G and H are relatively prime, then their
intersection contains only the identity.
