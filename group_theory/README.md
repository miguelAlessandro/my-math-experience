## Group Definition: 

A **group** is a set G together with an operation that taker two elements of _G_ and
combines them to produce a third element of _G_. the operation must also satisfy certain
properties.

More formally, the group operation is a function _G_ x _G_ -> _G_, which denoted by
\(x, y\) -> x \* y, satisfying the following properties (also known as the group axioms)

### Group axioms:

1. Associativity: For any x, y, z \in G, we have \(x\*y\)\*z = x\*\(y\*z\)
2. Identity: There exists an e \in _G_ such that e\*x = x\*e = x for any x \in G. 
We say that e is an identity element of _G_.
3. Inverse: For any x \in _G_, there exists a y such that x\*y = e. We say that
y is an inverse of x.

Note that the definition of the operation as a function implies

4. Clousure: For any x, y \in _G_, x\*y is also in _G_
